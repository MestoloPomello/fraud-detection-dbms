Assumptions:
1. We add an ID on Customer in order to univocally identify a customer.
2. We add an ID on Terminal in order to univocally identify a terminal.
3. We assume that there is a Geo_Location tuple with the x and y coordinates.
4. We assume that the period of the day for a Transaction is one of the values contained in the Period enumerator.
5. We assume that the product kind for a Transaction is one of the values contained in the Product Kind enumerator.

Constraints:
1. The x and y values of the Geo_Location must be between 0 and 100 (the min and max values of the grid).
2. The mean_spending_amount and std_spending_amount of a customer can't be greater than the maximum amount_paid for the customer's transactions or lesser than 0.
3. The feeling_of_security field of a transaction must be a value between 1 (low security) and 5 (high security).
